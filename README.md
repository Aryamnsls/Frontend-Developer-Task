# Frontend-Developer-Task

Makerble is a powerful platform with a wide variety of features. Many of the features were designed to be functional, which means that the features work well, but the UI of those features could be better. This means that if you are successful in gaining this role, you will get the opportunity to redesign several of the features on Makerble in order to make them more intuitive and enjoyable to use.

This Pre-Interview Task is designed to give you the opportunity to show us how you would apply your creativity to Makerble. Weâ€™ve chosen a UI design task which is similar to the type of UI work that you will be doing everyday if you succeed in gaining this role. 

UI Design Brief: the first page that people arrive on when they are invited to join their colleagues on Makerble, is the My Home page. This page contains a lot of information but we have received feedback that it feels overwhelming and confusing to people when they access the page for the first time. Your task is to reimagine what the My Home page could look like and redesign it so that all the same information that is currently there is accessible (e.g. via clicks, interactions, hovers or other methods) but not necessarily all displayed from the outset in a way that feels overwhelming.
